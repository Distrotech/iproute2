For Debian\r\nusers this is the package with a name like libdb4.x-dev.\r\nDBM_INCLUDE points to the directory with db_185.h which\r\nis the include file used by arpd to get to the old format Berkeley\r\ndatabase routines.  Often this is in the db-devel package.\r\n\r\n2. make\r\n\r\nThe makefile will automatically build a Config file which\r\ncontains whether or not ATM is available, etc.\r\n\r\n3. To make documentation, cd to doc/ directory , then\r\n   look at start of Makefile and set correct values for\r\n   PAGESIZE=a4\t\t, ie: a4 , letter ...\t(string)\r\n   PAGESPERPAGE=2\t, ie: 1 , 2 ...\t\t(numeric)\r\n   and make there. It assumes, that latex, dvips and psnup\r\n   are in your path.\r\n\r\n4. This package includes matching sanitized kernel headers because\r\n   the build environment may not have up to date versions. See Makefile\r\n   if you have special requirements and need to point at different\r\n   kernel include files.\r\n\r\nStephen Hemminger\r\nstephen@networkplumber.org\r\n\r\nAlexey Kuznetsov\r\nkuznet@ms2.inr.ac.ru\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
